# About this file

> This document more than a concise presentation of documentation for this react app is a sort of archive where I want to put all my decisions,blocks,victories,regrets while building this project.
>
> Haven't seen something like that in other projects and I thought it could be interesting and useful mainly because:
>
> - Archiving/writing is how I learn best
> - I want to show what I understand (and don't) about the project in an explicit way. I think that at a time where AI abuse is so easy to fall into as a junior dev, having this type of documentation even if it's not for a super complex app it's useful.
